  SIGPROC-based pulsar search pipeline built with the intent of training the contributor.
  It can search throgh a specified range of DM values, fold at a desired period value or zap undiserid frequencies in the Fourirer domain.
  As of now, no acceleration search is included.
  This pipeline is very easy to edit and improve, as it only uses two layers of scripts: the mother scripts and the ones they rely on.
  Further development in the future is unlikelly but not impossible.
  There are 5 main scripts and and 5 auxiliary ones.
  The main scripts consist of findCandidates.sh, findPulsarInterval.sh, findPulsarSegmented.sh, findRFI.sh and foundPulsar.sh.
  These are intended to work as the "mother scripts" that the user relies on.
  Each of them has an extensive header providing further details on their usage and functionality.
  They also rely on 5 further scripts to perform some computations and data manipulations.
  Thes are dm.py, dmFactor.py, findPeriod.py, findSN.py and time.py.
  None of these are intended to be used by the user directly, but they also have headers expaining their functions.
  More details are found in the README file or the script's headers.
